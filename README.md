# legend-shared

Shared code used across Legend applications for universal server-side functionality - hosting static files, performing authentication etc.

The important tenets for this project are:
* Code must be genuinely used by the majority of Legend applications
* New dependencies must be carefully scrutinized - the goal is to minimize unnecessary dependencies in apps.

## Development setup

This application uses Maven 3.6+ and JDK 8. Simply run `mvn install` to compile.
